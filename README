phpfarm
=======

Set of scripts to install a dozen of PHP versions in parallel on a system.
It also creates a pyrus installation for each php version.
Primarily developed for PEAR's continuous integration machine.

The PHP source packages are fetched from museum.php.net which is not
always up-to-date. If a file cannot be found, try to fetch it manually
and put it into src/bzips/


Setup
-----
- Check out phpfarm from svn:
  svn co http://svn.php.net/repository/pear/ci/phpfarm/trunk/ phpfarm
- cd phpfarm/src/
- ./compile.sh 5.3.0
- PHP gets installed into inst/php-$version/
- inst/bin/php-$version is also executable
  You should add inst/bin to your $PATH


Customization
-------------
Default configuration options are in src/options.sh.
You may create version-specific custom option files:
- custom-options.sh
- custom-options-5.sh
- custom-options-5.3.sh
- custom-options-5.3.1.sh
The shell script needs to define a variable "$configoptions" with
all ./configure options. Do not try to change prefix and exec-prefix.

php.ini values may also be customized:
- custom-php.ini
- custom-php-5.ini
- custom-php-5.3.ini
- custom-php-5.3.1.ini
